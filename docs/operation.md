## 1. Getting Started

### Connecting
1. Decide the nature of expected activities. 
2. Open box and check for any loose items or obvious issues.
3. If the motors are not needed skip to step x.
4. Connect motor harnesses starting with power (thick wire and 2 pin plugs). Make sure to connect left motor to left ports and right motor to right ports.
5. Connect signal wires accordingly to location of motors (left/right) and tighten collars. Ensure wires are not hanging loose as they may catch on something.
6. Choose power source (refer to Power sources) and attach it accordingly.

### Power sources
# 1. Battery pack (big black box)
   Make sure the breaker on top is off (indicated by the tab being outside and at an angle to the box. Press the button on top to make sure. To use connect the silver plug into the matching big plug in the back of the box. Tighten collar. Connect breaker again by pushing tab towards the slot or horizontal position. Power is now connected.
# 2. Mains power through DC power supply
   Connect power supply to wall and turn on dial to a voltage at least 18V or higher. Connect the XT90-barrel jack adapter cable to the auxiliary DC port on top of the box. Connect the barrel jack on the DC power supply (male) to the adapter cable (female). The box should now have power.
# 3. Mains power through DC power supply and charger box
   Similarly to above connect DC power supply to mains and then the charger box. Connect XT90 extension cable to charger box. On the charger box note the voltage set. It needs to be above 18V. By clicking SET you can cycle through the settings. We only set voltage(V) and current (A). The charger is used to charge battery usually so the limits for that are 25.2V and 4.5A. You can use the UP and DOWN arrows to change values and then press and hold SET to save that change. Make sure that when using the DC power supply the current never exceeds 5A (limit of DC supply) and usually allow 0.2-0.5 A space for stability. Press the OK button to enable charger. The green light should turn on. Then you can connect the XT90 connector to the top of the box.


### Charging the battery
You can charge the battery while connected and powering the box or seperately. If charging using the box refer to 3. in Power sources and also following steps:
1. On DC power supply set voltage to 20V max.
2. Set the charger settings to 25.2V and 4.5A. Confirm the changes by pressing and holding SET if needed.
3. Connect battery to box and charger to top port.
4. Press OK on the charger box. The lights should turn on. Yellow light means that the charging is limited according to current and will usually be the case when starting to charge. Green light will switch on instead when charging has progressed to Constant voltaget mode.
